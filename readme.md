terracoder is a game for programmers.

You play as a drone technician woken up in deep space to resolve a problem with
the advance terraforming robots. If their mission fails, you and thousands of
your fellow passengers will surely perish.

On board are families who resigned themselves to hurling into space for
countless frozen generations, with no idea of their destination.

You are their last hope.

I'm working on this with limited free time, so if anything seems broken, bear
with me and I'll get to it when I can. In the mean-time, if you think it's a
client-side bug, feel free to send a pull request.
