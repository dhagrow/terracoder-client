## Story

You are a drone technician woken up in deep space to resolve a problem with
the advance terraforming robots. If their mission fails, you and thousands of
your fellow passengers will surely perish.

On board are families who resigned themselves to launching into outer space for
countless frozen generations, with no idea of their destination.

You are their last hope.

## Access

The game server is live here: https://terracoder.dhagrow.org/ The server API is
simply POST requests with JSON encoded parameters. All documentaion for the game
is provided by the API. GET requests for commands that take no arguments are
accepted as a convenience.

I'm working on this with limited free time, so if anything seems broken, bear
with me and I'll get to it when I can. In the mean-time, if you think it's a
client-side bug, feel free to send a pull request.
